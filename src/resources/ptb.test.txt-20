 why <unk> 
 but these are not the differences that make <unk>

 we do n't need this as a way to get capital gains he said 
 opponents of the cut are playing <unk> 
 such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month 
 the senate bill was <unk> back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress 
 the house appears reluctant to join the senators

 these include a child-care initiative and <unk> of <unk> tax breaks for low-income housing and <unk> expenditures 
 mr. <unk> said he hopes the senate will consider that measure soon 
 things had just gone too far 
 sen. dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator 
 it worked others said because there were no exceptions all <unk> provisions were <unk> 
 a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was <unk>

 <unk> <unk> 
 friday 's big drop she says was not a crash 
 this was an october massacre like those that occurred in N and N 
 now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive 
 so she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained 
 those <unk> lasted one to four weeks and took the market N N down she says 
 this is exactly the same thing as far as i 'm concerned 
 thus she says if the dow jones industrial average dropped below N it would just be a <unk> 
 my advice is to buy 
 as she <unk> it the average stock now sells for about N times companies ' earnings 
 <unk> davis 
 but mr. davis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no <unk> crash 
 there was a unique combination in N he says 
 margin debt was at a record high 
 there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds 
 the main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses 
 a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it 
 in N such selling contributed to a <unk> effect 
 over the next several months though he says things look bad 
 i think the market will be heading down into november he says 
 we will probably have a year-end rally and then go down again 
 sort of a <unk> bear market 
 he expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around N sometime next year 
 that would be a normal bear market he says 
 i guess that 's my forecast 
 leon g. <unk> 
 i do n't think the market is going through another october <unk> 
 i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability 
 he <unk> off several major differences between now and two years ago 
 unlike N interest rates have been falling this year 
 unlike N the dollar has been strong 
 and unlike N the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of <unk> 
 so it 's a very mixed bag 
 thus he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks 
 we 're going to look for some of the <unk> companies that got <unk> friday 
 john kenneth <unk>

 why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk>

 this is n't quite a notebook i call it a <unk> he says

 the market is so new nobody knows yet how big it can be

 it 's huge 
 consider the growth of <unk> which now <unk> N N of all personal computer sales 
 <unk> generally anything under N pounds have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment with sales doubling this year 
 responding to that demand however has led to a variety of <unk> 
 making computers smaller often means <unk> memory 
 it also has <unk> use of the faster more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines 
 size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays 
 the competitive <unk> can get pretty <unk> at times 
 despite the <unk> few question the <unk> of the move to small machines that do n't make <unk> 
 but the <unk> product is twice as heavy and costs more than compaq 's 
 compaq is already taking aim at zenith 's market share

 the debate over national service has begun again 
 at least N bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in congress this spring 
 it might well win senate passage 
 president bush has outlined his own youth entering service yes plan though its details remain to be specified 
 what is one to think of all this 
 doctrine and special interests govern some responses 
 people eager to have youth pay their <unk> to society favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones 
 then there are <unk> opponents 
 to <unk> mandatory service is an <unk> and voluntary systems are <unk> uses of tax money 
 <unk> of the market question the value of the work national service would perform 
 if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost 
 but what about those of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk> 
 how should we think about national service 
 let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning 
 would service be voluntary or <unk> 
 short or long 
 <unk> or full-time 
 paid or unpaid 
 would participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public <unk> 
 what kinds of work would they do 
 what does national mean 
 would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations 
 and who would serve 
 only males as with the draft or both <unk> 
 youth only or all ages 
 middle-class people or poor people or a genuine <unk> 
 many or few 
 those are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them 
 then how should we think about national service 
 as a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> not the name 
 ignore national service in the <unk> consider specific proposals 
 they will differ in crucial ways 
 N service should be service 
 as commonly understood service implies sacrifice 
 it involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career 
 but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs 
 why call that service 
 N encouragement is fine <unk> is not 
 <unk> service is unconstitutional 
 it is also <unk> and <unk> 
 who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year 
 but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior 
 it should also encourage service <unk> by all classes and all ages 
 N good programs are not cheap 
 good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and supervision all of high quality 
 they involve <unk> to participants 
 <unk> programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year 
 are they worth that 
 <unk> suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted 
 but the calculations are <unk> 
 N <unk> youth are a special concern 
 are such expenditures <unk> then 
 yes if targeted 
 <unk> youth do n't have those opportunities 
 they are not <unk> in high school or college 
 they are unlikely to be employed 
 but many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> by productive and disciplined service 
 some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons 
 but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed 
 learning skills producing something <unk> feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them 
 strictly speaking these youth are not performing service 
 they are giving up no income deferring no careers <unk> no risk 
 that is a service to the nation 
 it is what federal support should try hardest to achieve
