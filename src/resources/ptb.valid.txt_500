 an american journalist now is standing trial in namibia 
 this is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election 
 the most likely winner will be the <unk> swapo rebels 
 the u.s. journalist 's crime was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness <unk> <unk> was openly sympathetic to swapo 
 shortly after that mr. <unk> had scott stanley arrested and his <unk> confiscated 
 mr. stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a <unk> issued by the south african administrator general earlier this year which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to <unk> <unk> or <unk> the election commission 
 the stanley affair does n't <unk> well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in namibia when swapo starts running the government 
 to the extent mr. stanley has done anything wrong it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the <unk> guerrillas were above all else the victims of <unk> by neighboring south africa 
 swapo has enjoyed favorable western media treatment ever since the u.n. general assembly declared it the sole <unk> representative of namibia 's people in 
 last year the u.s. <unk> a peace settlement to remove cuba 's <unk> <unk> from <unk> and hold free and fair elections that would end south africa 's control of namibia

 the u.s. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then <unk> its hands over the <unk> results

 commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge friday 
 yesterday the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness 
 later however it became more of an <unk> than a <unk> force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors 
 gold the traditional haven in times of financial crisis continued its <unk> <unk> with the dollar rising early in the day as the currency fell and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered 
 copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy 
 copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved 
 crude oil declined early but as the stock market retained early gains it too became stronger ending with a small net loss 
 trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines 
 in chicago grain and soybean prices rose slightly 
 livestock and meat prices however dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork 
 in commodity markets yesterday precious metals futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved <unk> first falling and then later rising 
 silver performed quietly 
 the spot october gold price rose $ N to $ N an ounce 
 the more active december delivery gold settled with a gain of $ N an ounce at $ N after trading as high as $ N 
 december silver was up N cents an ounce at $ N 
 platinum behaved more like an industrial metal easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy but recovering later as the stock market strengthened 
 gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on black monday 
 for one thing last friday precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its <unk> nose dive so it could n't react to it 
 back on friday oct. N <unk> the stock market declined during the day and gold prices surged as the stock market fell 
 the october N contract that day rose as much as $ N to as high as $ N and the more deferred positions due to mature as late as march N rose as much as $ N 
 on black monday oct. N N the october contract tacked on further gains rising to as high as $ N for a gain of almost $ N on top of the friday advances before giving up almost $ N of that at the close 
 yesterday 's october gain of $ N was <unk> compared with that 
 one analyst peter <unk> of <unk> & co. new york said the gold market already had some good <unk> technical factors that would have caused prices to rise with or without the stock market 
 what the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened said mr. <unk> 
 there 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further he said 
 he expects a drop in interest rates which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising 
 finally according to mr. <unk> the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the august merchandise trade deficit when the figures are released today 
 this would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold he said

 worried that friday 's 190-point stock market plunge might be a <unk> of things to come for the economy petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices 
 the u.s. benchmark crude west texas intermediate closed at $ N a barrel for november delivery down N cents 
 some analysts said crude was due for a correction <unk> following several days of significant gains 
 but most market observers agreed that friday 's stock market drop is what <unk> spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday 
 until yesterday futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong 
 the organization of petroleum exporting countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand 
 so any bearish indicator such as friday 's <unk> drop in the stock market sends <unk> through the oil markets as well 
 indeed after reacting early in the trading day to friday 's plummet futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday 
 copper 
 futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been <unk> prices appeared to be solved 
 the december contract declined N cents a pound to $ N 
 prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a <unk> reduction in copper use 
 but the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the highland valley mine in british columbia was about over according to an analyst 
 highland valley is a large canadian producer and principal supplier to japan which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank 
 last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle the contracting out of work by the company 
 now the analyst said only minor points remain to be <unk> up 
 for all <unk> and purposes an agreement appears to have been achieved he said 
 copper inventories in new york 's commodity exchange warehouses rose yesterday by N tons to N tons 
 london metal exchange copper inventories last week declined N tons to N tons 
 the <unk> stocks decline was about as expected but the comex gain was n't 
 however this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market the analyst said 
 at one point in futures trading as the stock market firmed the december contract rose to as high as $ N but it was n't able to sustain the gain 
 it was simply <unk> he said and selling by funds that are computer <unk> helped depress prices 
 cotton 
 futures prices eased more in reaction to hurricane jerry than to any influence of the stock market 
 the december contract ended with a loss of N cent a pound at N cents 
 technical considerations following the hurricane which was a factor in the market friday caused prices to decline yesterday said ernest simon cotton specialist for prudential-bache securities new york 
 prices rose sharply friday as the storm approached texas and louisiana which is part of the mississippi delta <unk> area 
 however after <unk> the potential effect of the hurricane prices began to slip late friday mr. simon said 
 that selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure he said 
 <unk> weather is being predicted for the high plains of texas and the northern states of the delta during the coming weekend mr. simon said 
 that has n't yet captured traders ' attention he added 
 sugar 
 futures prices declined 
 the march contract was off N cent a pound at N cents 
 at one point in early trading the march price rose to as high as N cents when the stock market recovered but the price then fell back 
 a <unk> factor one analyst said was that india which had been expected to buy around N tons of sugar in the world market did n't make any purchases 
 india recently bought N tons and was expected to buy more the analyst said 
 another analyst thought that india may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market 
 india may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar it could buy at lower prices said <unk> <unk> analyst for shearson lehman hutton new york 
 at any rate she added india needs the sugar so it will be in sooner or later to buy it 
 farm products 
 the prices of cattle and <unk> futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge friday will <unk> in the minds of u.s. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket which would hurt demand for beef and pork 
 the price of the <unk> contract for october delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of N cents a pound 
 the prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering 
 earlier in the session the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows

 the dow jones industrial average jumped sharply yesterday to close at N panic did n't sweep the world 's markets and investors large and small seemed to accept friday 's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction not a <unk>

 foreign stock markets which kicked off black monday with a huge selling spree began the day off by relatively modest amounts

 shortly after completing the $ N billion acquisition of west <unk> inc. in april mr. <unk> 's holding company <unk> inc. said it was considering the sale of cluett a leading <unk> maker and one of west <unk> 's biggest units

 the companies said the agreement is subject to <unk> 's <unk> of financing and to regulatory and other approvals 
 they said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of november

 britain 's blue arrow plc intends to change its name to manpower plc and write off a chunk of the nearly $ N billion in good will realized in the takeover of <unk> manpower inc 
 blue arrow chairman mitchell fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to <unk> the world 's biggest <unk> group in the u.s. 
 mr. fromstein disclosed the planned steps expected within a few months as blue arrow posted a N N drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings 
 the name change and good will write-off could help <unk> blue arrow 's dominance of the u.s. <unk> market and give it a more american image as u.s. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after friday 's market plunge 
 u.s. holders now own more than N N of blue arrow compared with N N last january 
 in the u.s. market the recognition of the manpower name is <unk> stronger than blue arrow mr. fromstein said 
 the moves also could <unk> shareholders ' perception of blue arrow as a company in turmoil 
 it further <unk> the concept that blue arrow is a thing of the past said doug arthur an analyst at kidder peabody & co. in new york 
 the proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me he added 
 in a widely publicized <unk> coup mr. fromstein ousted <unk> berry as blue arrow chief executive in january a month after mr. berry had forced mr. fromstein out as the $ N <unk> chief of <unk> manpower 
 mr. fromstein <unk> his control in april by taking over from mr. berry as chairman 
 but the blue arrow <unk> is n't over yet as the british government is investigating a disputed # N million $ N million loan which mr. fromstein has said was made under mr. berry 's direction 
 blue arrow was able to pull off the $ N billion takeover of manpower in N largely because different british and american accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for british companies 
 under british rules blue arrow was able to write off at once the $ N billion in good will arising from the purchase 
 as a <unk> company blue arrow would have to <unk> the good will over as many as N years creating a continuing drag on reported earnings 
 good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets 
 but with so many shares now held in the u.s. blue arrow reports its earnings two ways based on both u.k. and u.s. accounting standards 
 our balance sheets look like they came from alice 's <unk> mr. fromstein said 
 the british version shows a handful of pounds of net worth following the N write-off of good will while the american version reflects $ N billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off 
 mr. fromstein said he hopes to <unk> some of the good will left on blue arrow 's u.s. books in one fell <unk> but would n't specify how much 
 people close to blue arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk with executives claiming prior management <unk> the extent of manpower 's good will 
 that move along with the return to the manpower name could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help 
 the number of u.s. temporary workers fell about N N in the N months ending aug. N after sliding nearly N N in july said kidder peabody 's mr. arthur 
 blue arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended july N partly on slower earnings growth of <unk> units in britain 
 overall pretax profit slid to # N million in the quarter from # N million a year earlier 
 richard g. sim the man credited with <unk> applied power inc. from an <unk> into a <unk> player in the global market for <unk> tools hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition barry wright corp 
 the 45-year-old former general electric co. executive figures it will be easier this time 
 but analysts while <unk> the acquisition say applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in <unk> the two companies 
 barry wright acquired by applied for $ N million makes <unk> equipment and <unk> systems 
 the <unk> mass. company 's sales have been <unk> and its profits have dropped 
 last year 's earnings of $ N million including $ N from a restructuring gain were far below the year-earlier $ N million 
 besides spurring barry wright 's sales which were $ N million in N mr. sim must <unk> its costs and product line 
 the question is how long it 's going to take barry wright to make a contribution says f. john <unk> an analyst at blunt ellis <unk> in milwaukee 
 the answer will help determine whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr. sim 
 the butler wis. manufacturer went public at $ N a share in august N and mr. sim 's goal then was a $ N per-share price by N 
 strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule in august N 
 the stock has since <unk> trading around $ N a share last week and closing yesterday at $ N in national over-the-counter trading 
 but mr. sim has set a fresh target of $ N a share by the end of 
 reaching that goal says robert t. <unk> applied 's chief financial officer will require efficient reinvestment of cash by applied and <unk> of its healthy N N rate of return on operating capital 
 in barry wright mr. sim sees a situation very similar to the one he faced when he joined applied as president and chief operating officer in N 
 applied then a closely held company was <unk> under the management of its controlling family 
 while profitable it was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital he says 
 mr. sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at barry wright as it has at applied 
 he also <unk> an <unk> <unk> to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where <unk> is shared 
 mr. sim considers the new unit 's operations fundamentally sound and adds that barry wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors 
 with a little patience these businesses will perform very <unk> mr. sim says 
 within about six months things will be moving in the right direction he predicts 
 mr. sim figures it will be easier to turn barry wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat 
 when he came to applied i did n't have the power to execute as i do today he says 
 he was named chief executive officer of applied in N and became chairman last november 
 at applied mr. sim set growth as his first objective 
 he took the company public in an offering that <unk> applied about $ N million which helped launch the company 's acquisition program 
 sales climbed to an estimated $ N million in fiscal N ended aug. N from $ N million in fiscal N 
 the company expects that earnings which have marched steadily upward in recent years reached about $ N million or $ N a share in the fiscal year just ended up from $ N million in fiscal N and $ N million in N
