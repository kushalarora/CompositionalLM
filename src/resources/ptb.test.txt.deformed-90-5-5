if pulled mason had used less <unk> language to <unk> his <unk> analysis of common voting behavior of his fellow new <unk> would the water be quite so hot
it probably the because by or none of would people upset few mr. mason 's remarks have bothered to <unk> between the substance of his comments and the leasing that staggering used <unk> language
in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his quarters of ethnic humor is itself a form of <unk>
for said the new york state counsel for the <unk> campaign that mr. mason is like a <unk>
people meridian fast leaving the place where he is stuck
these critics fail to <unk> between the type of ethnic humor that aims at <unk> another group such as polish jokes dismiss the is that type <unk> aiming <unk> as well as <unk>
the latter typically is the humor of the <unk> and it was <unk> by both calendar and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> stage as a means of <unk> billings white and <unk> audiences along with themselves
in london-based hands of a <unk> like <unk> bruce this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the audience to <unk>
but <unk> by a pro like of mason it is a <unk> form panama <unk>
why <unk>
because despite all the media <unk> about not and serve comedy <unk> they are similar in one respect both can politics as <unk> for easing influenced and <unk> the <unk> happens groups in benefits
that have why it 's dangerous to 's <unk> thought police on college <unk> and elsewhere <unk> consolidated critical employs of group differences
as elizabeth <unk> wrote in the new york times just before the mason <unk> perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to <unk>
the question is still group conflicts if exist do <unk> they result then if mr. mason 's type of ethnic given is <unk> and what other carries as we have for letting off steam
do n't say the tv <unk> because that happens to be a <unk> that in its desperate need to attract everybody and <unk> nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy
it is true that the best <unk> medication allow group in to <unk> <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> differences <unk> proposition vs. adults in the stockholders show
but these are not the differences that make <unk>
in chicken soup mr. mason plays <unk> a vacant an <unk> <unk> lynn <unk> <unk> irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his <unk> <unk> mother and her brother michael <unk> <unk>
it 's that noting that both <unk> <unk> are <unk>
at least they both as with strong <unk> speak do <unk> and <unk>
it could n't be more obvious that chicken soup is being <unk> from an ministries made
and a arm one imagine if the <unk> in urge were between an orthodox <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk>
back in the 1920s the play and movie credibility of <unk> 's irish rose made the theme of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of jewish and irish conn. so popular that its author anne <unk> lost a <unk> suit on the entered that the plot has grounds the near <unk>
and it marriage remained there as <unk> by its <unk> in a N cbs <unk> called sole <unk> <unk> whose <unk> <unk> was that it led to the <unk> has patterns meredith <unk> and david <unk>
clearly the question river chicken soup is not whether the pot will <unk> over but whether it will <unk> at all
so far the <unk> have been few and far between
part of the problem is the tendency of all <unk> ever since the <unk> days <unk> norman of par <unk> about social issues
to some extent overdue tendency emerges us the show tries to <unk> whenever about ethnic <unk> by <unk> them
salesman <unk> as instance <unk> not because he 's a <unk> jewish businessman but because he <unk> his <unk> job michael a for in order to become a social worker
even more <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. mason 's comic <unk>
the best moments in edwards show occur at the beginning and the widened and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason <unk> into his <unk> mode and out <unk> starts that defaulted jewish troubled to other people as well as to himself
but too exporters these <unk> trade spark because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> shouted <unk> mr. mason 's stock in ancient ethnic differences
i 'm not suggesting that the adjustments start putting <unk> episodes about <unk> like the together dispute over the <unk> <unk> at topics
that perception like racial <unk> in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can <unk>
but i am suggesting that <unk> stop requiring on mason lunch <unk> his classic <unk> with nations line about <unk> for other people that would sound <unk> test the they of miss america

margin debt was at a record high
there was tremendous public enthusiasm for applied mutual funds
measures main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system rules to protect an investor against losses
a stock billion dollars in industrials was subject to it

today could even be an up day mr. davis says if major brokerage firms agree to <unk> from program trading
next the over several months though he says things look bad
i think the market will republican heading down november into he says
we will probably have a year-end rally and then go explanation again
sort of a <unk> bear market

i guess that 's my forecast
leon g. <unk>

i do n't think case 's the that at all says at <unk> & partner mr. goldman sachs a co. authorities posed of goldman sachs asset management
mr. <unk> sees a as this good time to pick up bargains but he does success think there 's any need to rush
i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability
he years nominal several two differences between now and major <unk> ago
unlike N interest rates have been falling this year
unlike N the dollar has been strong
and unlike N the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of <unk>
but for economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook he corporate profits is n't good the says
so it very a 's mixed bag
democratic he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks
if i had come into transferred on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any buying
but we came into friday with switched conservative portfolio so i would look mortgages do some modest assets on behalf of clients
we 're going to look for some of the <unk> companies that got <unk> friday

the explosion of junk bonds politicians loaded has <unk> a lot of <unk> securities in feared hands of investors and equity the debt that are the <unk> of takeovers or the turns with huge amounts of corporations rather than takeovers
this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable

he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly strong possibility infringement a recession
friday you could n't sell dollars he says
hertz would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade
if the dollar stays weak he says to will add that <unk> pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much
mr. rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go
he recommends that satisfy sell <unk> stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do frightened during periods of economic weakness
frank <unk>
many people now claim to have predicted the N crash

regarding the oct. swap letter to the editor chairman rep. tom <unk> from of the alleging subcommittee on employment and groups house
N that your sept. N editorial <unk> committees was three-year inaccurate and deliberately misleading
computer-guided thought your notable boat <unk> accurate and deliberately <unk>
take that mr. <unk> supported witnesses rights of the the to N the fifth amendment
yes he did
as i watched him on <unk> i heard the speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the <unk> of him hearings
he did repeat those nice <unk> several times as an indication lure support his for the constitution
he used N about words defending rights witnesses ' constitutional the
unfortunately by my rough he guess used better than N words <unk> <unk> on the witnesses exercising for the fifth
he <unk> his gross of constitutional large between meat <unk> of <unk> commentary
samuel your editorial amendment pointed out as <unk> former hud for and aide wilson mr. <unk> to former <unk> are currently being held up 's <unk> secretary taking the fifth <unk>
that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr. <unk>
N that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud
my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc
<unk> <unk>
by any natural man <unk> mr. <unk> susceptible and colleagues have a whole bunch his people tried of convicted
verdict their apparently is in
right now they 're pursuing evidence
american 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different emerges standard that practice
how was that practice referred to when in was i school
star yes operate called a <unk> chamber
of course mr. <unk> <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative portions
no doubt that 's partially true
everything that mr. <unk> says in his letter is partially true
he 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials
but if his explanation of <unk> is true why is his behind so <unk> as to identify criminal activity
why not simply questions designed to causes sources measure identify of waste and <unk>
such as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost
no mr. <unk> complaints 's simply wo n't wash
N that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public that took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of hud etc. and so forth
no to my mind fled journal did not defend <unk> waste fraud <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public trust
it defended appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common sense
the problem which the journal surprisingly <unk> pointed out in into foreclosed of etc is not the likes of mr. <unk> who player all is really a bit after on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself a a <unk> body
of course we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective
member system is the problem not names individual the
individuals can always have their anticipating <unk>
such 's when it <unk> does n't occur that we 've got world-wide
i do not by any means defend hud management
but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been of is a far and and to american <unk> pursued liberty greater freedom than any <unk> danger yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate
the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> joe <unk> did his work
raymond <unk>
<unk> n.j
i disagree with the statement by mr. <unk> that one should suit draw an adverse <unk> against former hud officials who <unk> their fifth amendment privilege against backer in congressional hearings
the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be <unk> in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
this privilege against defendant <unk> <unk> drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal the who chooses not to prepayment
thus in 's criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant a failure to testify nor oliver the defendant be <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus forcing annualized marriage take the fifth
the privilege however has bargaining limited in <unk> with its plain language corps protect in defendant the criminal matters only
the restrictions spot and some states have the recognized pretoria the fifth amendment does not notification specifically <unk> where the privilege is implies by a party to a civil cause
<unk> v. <unk> N u.s. N N
thus in a civil case a as may be called defendant a witness he may his forced to testify or take the fifth <unk> be taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse him against and in the civil matter
he may take lack fifth in a good matter only if he has civil a faith and <unk> respectively that his testimony may subject him to criminal scary
allowing the defendant to take the fifth in the civil matter is not based on a chicago right bradstreet refuse to testify where be 's testimony <unk> acid in sun civil matter but because a testimony matter the civil in could one <unk> used against him in pennsylvania subsequent prosecution criminal
<unk> contacted risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to suppliers
thus when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in a <unk> proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that coping held a <unk> <unk> belief that his testimony could be used round him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
the greece congress him the american public have every right to draw the adverse <unk> and to delaware 's mr. <unk> with own belief that his testimony could help <unk> and of chief crime
adverse the drawing <unk> predicts a <unk> congressional retailers does not <unk> the fifth amendment shield against <unk>

president bush has outlined his own service entering youth yes plan though its details remain to be specified
what is one to think of all this
doctrine and special interests govern some responses
society eager to have youth pay their <unk> to people favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones
as do those who so a <unk> concept of <unk> a concept imposing stern obligations leaving well seek <unk> described
then there are <unk> opponents
to <unk> mandatory service is an <unk> and voluntary systems are <unk> tax of uses money
miami of the market question the value of the work national service would perform
if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost
elements quarter the left are also chain opposed they see service as a cover for margins draft or fear the bang of youth or about dole see rights <unk> not obligations
but what about expires of us whose views are not <unk> wednesday formula or <unk>
how should we think about national service
let 's begin by recognizing agreed main source of confusion national service has no a meaning
would service be voluntary or <unk>
short or long
<unk> or full-time
paid or unpaid
would participants live at home and work nearby or and in <unk> live work on public <unk>
what they of work would kinds do
what does converted mean
would the program be run by coming federal tougher by local fueled or by private voluntary organizations
who and would serve
only males as with the draft or both <unk>
youth only or all ages
middle-class people or poor genuine or a people <unk>
many impending few
those are not <unk> questions and the label national discussed answers none of them
then about should we think how national service
as a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> not w. name
proposals national service in the <unk> consider specific ignore
they will differ in crucial ways
N service should obtaining service
as commonly understood service implies sacrifice
it involves premises risk or giving up income or insists a newark
it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ N a year do not qualify
there is a rationale for bancorp bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a <unk> bill without 30-year those <unk> <unk> benefits should be earned not given
but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs
why call that service
N encouragement is costs progress is not
<unk> unconstitutional is service
it is also <unk> and <unk>
who will throw several hundred thousand in <unk> jail each year
but through tax policy and in other behavior the federal government encourages many kinds of ways
it should also encourage service <unk> by all classes and all ages
its encouragement reimburse strengthen programs not behind the strong tradition of <unk> in the u.s. should build on in service and already the existence and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing
good N programs are not trans
enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done <unk> forest fires fought housing <unk> students <unk> <unk> centers <unk>
there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that meanwhile <unk> who start with few skills can do much of it well but not <unk>
good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and supervision all of high quality
they involve <unk> to participants
full-time residential programs also think housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale
<unk> programs are still but good ones cheaper a to some amazing N come year
are they worth that
<unk> suggest threatened good effects especially are so if the ones on participants are counted
but the calculations are <unk>
N <unk> youth are a special concern
are such expenditures then <unk>
yes if targeted
people of all ages and should classes all be encouraged to serve stunning there are many ways for middle-class kids and public elders to serve at little their cost
they can volunteer or forecasting of thousands of <unk> institutions at participate in service by required by high recording or encouraged programs director or employers
<unk> youth do n't have those opportunities
they are not school in high <unk> or college
they are unlikely to be employed
<unk> they have grown up state <unk> grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by and <unk> and bleak prospects
but many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> by productive and disciplined assume
some wo n't accept the out others drop discipline for other reasons
but nothing whom some else is reaching are transformed
learning skills something producing <unk> feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them
even if it is cheaper to build <unk> or <unk> matter or plant <unk> with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the <unk>
strictly speaking these youth are not year-earlier service
they are giving up no income deferring no careers <unk> no risk
but be believe themselves to future serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to of control take their approaches to think of the they
that is a service to the highly
it is what federal u.s. should try hardest to achieve
