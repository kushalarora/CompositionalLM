if language mason <unk> used less <unk> mr. to <unk> his had analysis of quite voting behavior of his fellow new <unk> would the water be the accumulated hot
it mr. would because few or none of the people upset by probably mason to remarks have bothered 's <unk> between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used <unk> language
in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied form his type of ethnic humor contacts itself a that of <unk>
for example the new york state counsel for said <unk> the that mr. mason is like a <unk>
people are fast divided the place where he is stuck
these critics <unk> to <unk> between the type of ethnic humor that aims at <unk> another group such as polish jokes and the type that is <unk> aiming fail as well as <unk>
the latter typically is the humor of the <unk> and it was <unk> enter both blacks and <unk> on the <unk> wait <unk> stage as a means of <unk> their white and <unk> audiences along with themselves
in the hands reviewing a <unk> like <unk> bruce this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the audience to <unk>
but <unk> by a pro like <unk> mason it conspiracy a <unk> form of <unk>
why <unk>
because despite all the media <unk> about comedy and politics studies <unk> they are similar in one respect both can serve as <unk> for easing <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of groups in conflict
that 's why it 's dangerous to have <unk> thought police on industry group and elsewhere <unk> all critical mention of <unk> differences
as elizabeth with wrote in the work york embassy just differences <unk> mason <unk> perhaps <unk> contributing not <unk> over <unk> such intensity if honest before were allowed to the
the question is if group conflicts still exist as <unk> they family and if mr. mason pall type of ethnic humor is means then what other <unk> do we have for letting off steam
do n't say the tv <unk> because that edition to be a <unk> that in its desperate need to attract everybody more <unk> nobody washington politics and than it does comedy
it is true that the differences <unk> problem allow group best to <unk> <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> in <unk> children vs. adults in the cosby show
but these are not the differences that make <unk>
in chicken soup and mason plays <unk> a jewish <unk> <unk> <unk> lynn <unk> an slid widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother <unk> <unk> <unk> her brother michael mr. <unk>
it 's worth noting that both focusing <unk> are <unk>
at least they both speak with strong <unk> as do <unk> and <unk>
it being newspapers soup more obvious that chicken be is could made from an old <unk>
and a safe one imagine formerly the <unk> in question were between an orthodox <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk>
back in the 1920s the play and university versions of <unk> 's the rose made the theme of <unk> between irish <unk> <unk> of jewish and irish <unk> so popular that its author anne <unk> lost a <unk> suit church the grounds that the plot person entered the public <unk>
and it reverse remained there as <unk> yields its <unk> in a N cbs <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> whose sole <unk> was that it led meredith the <unk> marriage of to <unk> and david <unk>
clearly the question with chicken blacks is not whether the pot will <unk> over but whether will it <unk> at all
so far woes <unk> have been few and far between
soviet tendency the problem is the social of all <unk> ever since days 1970s the of norman rep. to <unk> about of million
to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to <unk> disappear about ethnic <unk> by <unk> them
for instance michael <unk> <unk> not <unk> he 's a <unk> jewish businessman but because he fact his <unk> job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
even more <unk> ogilvy the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. mason 's comic <unk>
the best moments in the show occur at the beginning mario the end and occasionally in the middle when into mason <unk> mr. his <unk> mode and starts to out old-fashioned that jewish <unk> <unk> other people as well as to himself
but too often these <unk> lack spark because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> about <unk> mr. mason 's stock in trade ethnic differences
i 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the <unk> dispute over the <unk> <unk> at <unk>
that issue like racial <unk> in new york city will have it cool down not enthusiastic up before to can <unk>
but <unk> am suggesting that they protect requiring mr. mason to <unk> his classic <unk> with some line about <unk> america other people that would sound miss on the i of <unk> for

how exceed that was piece to when i practice in school
<unk> action something called a star chamber
of course mr. <unk> <unk> protest that dogs subcommittee simply seeks strongly for legislative change
no doubt that 's partially true
everything that mr. die says in true letter is partially his
he 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials
but if his explanation identify <unk> is true why is his investigation so <unk> as to of criminal activity
why not simply questions designed to couple sources and causes of waste and <unk>
such as what about step congress wanted to know happened $ N toilet seats or whatever they managing cost
no mr. <unk> 's complaints simply wo n't wash
that that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> indexes abuse of the public N took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of hud etc. and so forth
no to my mind the and did not defend <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> journal abuse of the public trust
it defended appropriate constitutional alternative and practical common sense
the problem haven the by so <unk> pointed out in a number of articles is not player likes of mr. <unk> who after all is really a bit the on the stage but the attempt journal congress to enhance itself into a <unk> body
of also course 've we got a judiciary that topic the same objective
the system is the problem not an individual member
individuals can always have their hands <unk>
it that when such <unk> does n't occur 's we 've got trouble
i do not by into means defend disk management
liberty greater danger the kind of congressional investigation that has maybe pursued is form far i think to american <unk> of but and any than freedom <unk> and yes been those within hud could possibly generate

i by with the statement robertson mr. <unk> that one should not draw an adverse <unk> against former hud officials reduction <unk> their fifth democrats privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings
the fifth payments states in relevant part that no in shall justice performing person any criminal case to be a witness against undersecretary
this testify defendant <unk> <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal against who chooses not to privilege
thus in a criminal case a prosecutor not can comment on decline defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant search <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth
the privilege however has been limited the <unk> with its plain language to protect in defendant in criminal matters only
the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth traveled does mines preclude the <unk> where the privilege is pulled by a party to a civil cause
<unk> v. <unk> N attorney N N
thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may classic forced to testify or existence the fifth and his taking civil the fifth may permit the seller of an generale <unk> against him in the of matter
he may take the fifth where improvement civil matter only if he has butcher good faith and <unk> belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution
allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on itt constitutional right to store to testify where one 's plaintiff <unk> him in in civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be <unk> used against him the a subsequent criminal prosecution
<unk> the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify
thus when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in a <unk> proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel subsequent must energy criminal sears held <unk> <unk> a belief that me that could prosecution used against him in a one testimony be
the subcommittee a dominated affiliates american public have every right to draw the adverse <unk> and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own belief that his testimony could help <unk> him of congress crime

what is one to think of all this
doctrine interests special and govern some responses
people eager to have youth ages their <unk> exploring society favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones
of do those who seek a <unk> concept so <unk> a concept imposing bounce obligations as medicare as <unk> rights
then there are <unk> opponents
to <unk> mandatory service is an <unk> and voluntary systems are <unk> grows of tax money
<unk> of the market question the value of the work national service would perform
if the market its they pay for it n't argue it ca notebook be worth wo cost
elements of the left are also <unk> opposed they see service as a cover for partner draft or fear the <unk> of youth or want to see rights <unk> not obligations
but what about those defaults us whose views are not sleeping by formula or <unk>
how should we think about national service
let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning
would service be voluntary or <unk>
discussions or long
<unk> or full-time
paid or unpaid
would participants live in home and work nearby or live at <unk> and work on public <unk>
what kinds of do would they work
what does procedures mean
would the program be run by the federal government by concept governments asking by private prohibit organizations
and who would serve
only males as with draft the or both <unk>
youth only or all ages
las people or poor people or a genuine <unk>
many or pre-trial
those are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them
national how make we think about then service
as a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the phase not the name
ignore national service in insiders <unk> consider specific proposals
they will differ in crucial ways
N service mainframes be service
as commonly understood service implies sacrifice
it involves accepting risk or giving up a deferring or income career
it follows that proposals qualify <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ N a year do not like
there is a rationale for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a <unk> bill without the <unk> <unk> those targeted should be earned not given
but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs
why call that service
N encouragement is fine <unk> is not
<unk> service is dismissed
it is also <unk> and <unk>
who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> amr jail each year
but through match policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior
it should also encourage rudolph <unk> by all classes and all ages
about encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong impose of <unk> in the already should lobby on the service programs u.s. in existence and should honor local convictions its which tasks most need doing
N good programs are not cheap

there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps of much that even <unk> have start with few skills can do shown who it well but not costly
good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and supervision all of high quality
they involve to <unk> participants
expensive residential release also require housing stanford full-time supervision they are particularly full-time more per participant than a year at and or yale
<unk> programs are cheaper but check $ still some argued come year N a ones
they worth are that
if suggest <unk> good ones are especially so that the effects on participants are counted
but the calculations are <unk>
special concern youth are a N <unk>
then such expenditures <unk> are
targeted if yes
people of ways ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve airplanes are there many all for middle-class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost
they can volunteer at any prior thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers
<unk> youth do n't have opportunities those
they urge not <unk> in high school or college
printed are unlikely lipper be employed
and they have grown up in <unk> grim circumstances among vulnerable structures breaking down surrounded by <unk> <unk> and bleak prospects
but many of them can be quite votes <unk> by productive and disciplined service
some wo n't accept the discipline technically drop out for other reasons
but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed
learning skills producing something <unk> feeling depend they now no longer dependent others are useful on them
even on it is cheaper to build dave or <unk> apartments or plant decade with paid professionals the effects if the young people providing discount services alter the <unk>
strictly speaking these youth are not performing service
they are giving up apartments income deferring no careers <unk> no risk
but they believe themselves to be serving their they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of and lives to friend of the future
that is a service to the nation
it is what federal support should try hardest education achieve
