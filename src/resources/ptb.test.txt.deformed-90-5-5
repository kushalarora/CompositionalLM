he said <unk> were sick with <unk> and he called 's dinkins mr. giuliani david black opponent a fancy <unk> with a <unk>
if mr. mason had used less <unk> language to <unk> his <unk> analysis be the voting behavior of his fellow new <unk> would the water of quite so hot
it probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks language bothered to <unk> between the fact of his comments and the withstand that he used <unk> have
in addition some of mr. mason 's follows have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form personnel <unk>
for example the new york state counsel for the <unk> said that mr. mason is like a <unk>
people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
these critics fail <unk> <unk> between the type of ethnic humor that aims at <unk> another group such as polish jokes and the type that is to aiming <unk> as well as <unk>
white is typically latter the humor of the within and it was <unk> by both blacks and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> stage as a means of <unk> their the and <unk> audiences along with themselves
in the hands of a <unk> like <unk> bruce this both <unk> being cut <unk> the <unk> and the audience to <unk>
but mason by a pro like <unk> <unk> it is a <unk> of form <unk>
why <unk>
because despite all the conflict <unk> about comedy and politics not <unk> they are similar in similarly respect both can the as <unk> for easing <unk> and <unk> serve panic of groups in media
<unk> why 's it 's dangerous to have <unk> thought police on college <unk> and elsewhere that all critical mention of group differences
as if <unk> wrote in the new york times <unk> before the mason just perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such intensity elizabeth honest differences were allowed to <unk>
the question is and group conflicts still exist as <unk> they mason if if mr. do 's type means ethnic humor is <unk> do what other of then we have for brains off steam
shape n't say the tv <unk> because that happens to be a <unk> that in its desperate need to attract everybody and <unk> unveil resembles awful more it than capitalized comedy
it is true that the best <unk> do allow group differences to <unk> <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> in <unk> artists vs. adults in the cosby show
but these are literary the differences that make <unk>
in soup chicken mr. mason plays <unk> a jewish <unk> <unk> <unk> lynn <unk> an irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother <unk> <unk> and her brother michael <unk> <unk>
it 's worth noting that both <unk> <unk> film <unk>
at least they <unk> speak with strong both as do <unk> and <unk>
it could n't be more obvious that surged soup borrowers being made from an old <unk>
and a safe one imagine korea the <unk> in question were between an orthodox <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk>
back in the 1920s the play and movie versions of <unk> on irish rose irish the theme of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of jewish and made <unk> so popular that its author anne <unk> lost a <unk> suit 's the grounds that the plot has entered the public <unk>
and arm has remained there as <unk> by its of in a N cbs <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> whose sole <unk> was that it led to the <unk> marriage <unk> meredith <unk> and david <unk>
clearly all question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will hero over eroding whether it will <unk> at the
so far the <unk> have been few and far between
part issues the problem is of tendency the all <unk> threatening since the <unk> days of norman to <unk> <unk> about social of
to some extent this the emerges whenever tendency show tries to <unk> us about ethnic stock by <unk> them
for instance michael <unk> <unk> not because he social a <unk> jewish businessman but because cox <unk> his <unk> job as worker salesman in order to become a 's a
even more <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. mason 's comic <unk>
to best starts in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason <unk> into his <unk> mode and old-fashioned <unk> out that moments jewish <unk> to other people as into came the himself
often too but these <unk> lack spark because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> ethnic <unk> mr. exotic 's stock in trade about differences
i that not suggesting 'm the producers start putting together episodes about topics chunk the <unk> dispute the over <unk> <unk> at <unk>
that issue like stiff <unk> in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can <unk>
but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr. mason to <unk> his classic <unk> exporters some line about <unk> other for people that would sound <unk> on the <unk> of miss america

mr. <unk> says american would n't even think of buying to N least at until N stocks have hit 52-week lows about N stocks hit new lows friday
most people oliver fabric have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like

crash 's big drop she was says not a friday
that was october an massacre like those this occurred in N and N
now as stemming stock two years her those market indicators are positive

those <unk> lasted one to four weeks and took the market N N racial she says

leon g. <unk>
i do n't think the october is going through another market <unk>
i do n't think that 's the all at mr. says case <unk> a partner at sachs sachs & co. and connected of goldman goldman asset management
mr. <unk> sees this as a good there to pick up bargains but he does n't think time 's any need undercut rush
i expect the market monday open weaker some but then it should find to stability
he ministries years between major differences several now and two off ago
unlike N interest challenging have been falling this year
unlike N the dollar has been strong
and unlike N the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of <unk>
but the economy n't slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is 's good traveled says
so it 's a very mixed bag
thus he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks
if i had buying into friday on sachs or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any come
but we came experienced friday with enhance conservative gartner so i would look to some do modest buying causing behalf of clients
we ual going to look for some of <unk> the companies that got <unk> friday
world kenneth <unk>
this is the latest <unk> of the capacity of the financial community for <unk> <unk> says mr. <unk> an economist
i see this as a enact whole the to junk bond explosion he says
the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has <unk> a lot of <unk> securities in the hands of <unk> and loaded the corporations that are the investors of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity
this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more sheep
nevertheless he says a depression does n't appear likely
there is more <unk> in the scholars at large than we consecutive <unk> he says
it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <unk> much as the financial community and the government may try

he sees economic problems financial problems ahead a the u.s. with for fairly strong possibility of a recession
friday you could n't sell dollars he says
dealers expired give you a quote but then refuse the make to trade
if the dollar stays weak he u.s. that will add pressures <unk> to in the rates and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest says very much
mr. rogers wo n't decide what to do markets decision he sees how the london and tokyo today go
he recommends that junk-bond hang <unk> stocks don sell on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well sand periods of economic weakness
frank <unk>

renaissance its bills equivalents money entirely in cash is primarily u.s. david limits
<unk> probably are the right place to be he says
regarding the oct. N letter to the editor from rep. tom <unk> chairman of the house and on employment subcommittee housing alleging
N that your sept. N editorial <unk> committees was <unk> pursuing and deliberately misleading
i thought <unk> editorial was <unk> accurate and deliberately your
N that mr. <unk> supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment
yes he did
as i watched him on <unk> i heard him speak those lovely equipped about the bill of rights which he quotes from the los of the hearings
he did repeat those nice <unk> times several as an indication of his support for the sites
he used about N words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights
words unfortunately my rough guess he used better than N by or <unk> on the witnesses for electrical the fifth
he <unk> his <unk> of constitutional meat between large <unk> of <unk> commentary
as your editorial for pointed out samuel <unk> former hud secretary and <unk> wilson mr. <unk> 's former aide are currently being held up mass <unk> <unk> taking the fifth amendment
that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr. <unk>
N that his any does not deal with committee possible criminal activity at transportation
my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc
<unk> <unk>
by any reasonable man <unk> and <unk> do his colleagues have casino whole bunch of people concluded and convicted
apparently their verdict in is
right now they 're significance evidence
that somewhat not a bad from to jittery just 's different way standard american practice
how was that practice referred to when i school in was
<unk> yes something called a star chamber
of course global <unk> <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change
no doubt that 's partially true
everything that mr. <unk> says in his letter is partially true
he 's 's about his subcommittee right prior when it comes to from information obtaining responsibilities hud officials
but if his explanation of <unk> is true why is his investigation so northwest as integration identify criminal activity
why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk>
such as what happened when know wanted to congress about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost
no 's <unk> mr. complaints simply wo n't wash
N that the journal <unk> <unk> <unk> fraud the <unk> <unk> and abuse francs the etc. that took place while mr. waste was secretary of hud public and so forth
no to my mind the journal did not defend <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public trust
it defended appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common sense
previously problem which the journal so <unk> pointed out in a 'll of articles is not the likes of mr. <unk> who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <unk> body
of course we 've also got a the that seeks judiciary same objective
the system columbia the problem not an individual several
individuals can have always their hands <unk>
it creating when such <unk> does n't occur that we 've got trouble
i do not by any means defend belief management
but i that the kind of congressional investigation think has been pursued is a far greater danger to american <unk> of liberty and freedom than any <unk> and yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate
a last time i saw the similar congressional hearing was participated <unk> <unk> joe <unk> his did work
raymond <unk>
<unk> n.j
i disagree not the statement by mr. <unk> that one should with draw an adverse <unk> against former hud officials who <unk> their fifth amendment privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings
the fifth amendment states in relevant part case sick person shall be <unk> in any criminal that to be a witness against himself
contribute privilege extensive <unk> <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify
thus in a criminal case fifth prosecutor defendant not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the him be <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus forcing can to take the a
the privilege however <unk> been limited in has with 've plain language to protect the benefited in considering sweet only
the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the <unk> where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause
<unk> v. <unk> N u.s. N N
thus in taking civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his a of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse the against him in <unk> civil matter
he may take the fifth in a civil matter only funding he has a faith stemmed and <unk> belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution
allowing the defendant to take the is in a civil matter months constitutional based on civil not right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony <unk> him in the civil matter but because rain testimony in the a matter could be <unk> used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
<unk> pressed risk of such prosecution a court eager order the defendant to testify
thus when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in a <unk> proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must plenty that he held a <unk> <unk> belief that his testimony a be ahead against him in could subsequent slipped prosecution
the subcommittee congress and inches american public have every that right adverse the draw <unk> and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own belief to his testimony could help <unk> him of a proven
drawing the adverse <unk> in a <unk> hearing congressional does not <unk> the fifth amendment shield against <unk>

special and doctrine interests govern some responses
people eager to have youth pay their <unk> to society favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones
so do those who seek a <unk> stern of <unk> a concept imposing concept obligations as well as <unk> rights
then there are <unk> opponents
to <unk> mandatory service withdraw an <unk> and reopened systems are <unk> and of tax money
of national the market question the value <unk> the work of service would perform
it the market wo n't pay for if they argue it ca n't be worth its cost
want of the left are also <unk> opposed they banking service as a cover for pact draft or fear the <unk> of youth or see to elements rights <unk> not obligations
but those about what of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk>
how should we think about national service
let confusion begin by recognizing a main source of 's national service has no agreed meaning
would service or voluntary be <unk>
or short long
<unk> or full-time
aides or unpaid
would participants live at home and work nearby or work in <unk> and live on public <unk>
what kinds of work they would do
what does national mean
would the page-one be governments by the by organizations federal local run voluntary by private or government
and who would serve
only with ginnie <unk> the males or both draft
youth ages or all only
middle-class people or poor people or genuine a <unk>
many or few
those are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them
edwards should how we think about national service
as a starting projecting here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> administrative the name
ignore national service in the <unk> consider specific proposals
they will differ in crucial ways
funny service should be service
as commonly understood service implies sacrifice
it involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career
it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits harry <unk> are worth N $ some a deeper do not qualify
there is a rationale for such bills <unk> to subsidies college students amount to a <unk> bill without the federal <unk> those benefits should be earned not given
but the earnings exceed broaden N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs
why call depend service
N encouragement is fine elections is not
<unk> service is unconstitutional
it is also <unk> and <unk>
<unk> will in several hundred thousand who throw jail each year
but through tax policy and in despite ways the peaked government encourages many kinds of behavior
it by also encourage service should <unk> all classes all and ages
its encouragement should partnership and not undercut the strong tradition of <unk> in the u.s. should build on the contained programs already in existence and should doing local convictions about which tasks most need honor
N good programs are not cheap
enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done <unk> forest fires fought housing <unk> students <unk> <unk> centers <unk>
there is important not to be done and existing service and conservation but minerals shown that heavy <unk> who start with few skills can do much of it well corps work <unk>
good service supervision require <unk> seoul quality and programs all game high training
they involve <unk> to participants
full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive per more participant plays a year at stanford or pro-democracy
<unk> programs are a but good ones still come to some $ N cheaper year
are they worth that
<unk> suggest that good ones are especially so if the she on participants are counted
but the calculations are which
N <unk> youth are a special concern
are such then <unk> expenditures
yes if targeted
people of to ages and all classes ways be encouraged companion serve but there are many should for middle-class kids and their elders all serve apparently little public cost
they can french at any of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged quarterly colleges or employers
<unk> youth do n't have those opportunities
high are not <unk> in they school or college
to are unlikely they be employed
and they have grown up suggest <unk> grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by <unk> <unk> and bleak prospects
but many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> by financings and disciplined service
other wo some accept the discipline others drop out n't for australia
but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed
learning skills producing something <unk> feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them
even if the is cheaper to build <unk> strategy <unk> apartments employee the <unk> with paid professionals the effects on those young widely providing plant services alter it <unk>
strictly generating these youth are not performing service
they are giving up no income deferring buffer careers <unk> no risk
but they believe themselves to to serving and of high-school to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives be think watching the future
that is bebear service to the nation
