 this phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress 
 this interpretation was officially endorsed by congress in N in the iran-contra report

 investors in stock funds did n't panic the weekend after mid-october 's 190-point market plunge

 we keep wondering what mr. gates wanted to say 
 perhaps he 'd have called for a <unk> political and economic system without a dominant communist party 
 or political arrangements to alleviate the <unk> and demands of soviet ethnic minorities and republics 
 it 's somehow ok for secretary baker himself however to say all the same things 
 in fact he did the quotes above are from mr. baker 's speech of two weeks ago 
 but everyone agrees that mr. gorbachev 's problems result from the failure of his own system 
 they can be relieved only by changing that system not by pouring western money into it 
 if a deal can be made to cut the world 's <unk> loose from moscow why not 
 we do n't expect much good from <unk> control but <unk> talks might <unk> eastern europe 
 yet much of the political culture seems intent on <unk> the bush administration for not helping mr. gorbachev 
 mr. baker seems especially sensitive to the washington <unk> known as <unk> 
 letting officials express their own <unk> can be educational 
 it is in the western interest to see mr. gorbachev succeed 
 the odds are against him as he himself would no doubt tell you 
 the ultimate outcome depends on what he does not on what we do

 among these crimes are murder on federal land presidential assassination and <unk> 
 the thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death including murder for hire 
 separately the senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of <unk> who kill americans abroad 
 for one thing it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences let alone be executed 
 in that sense the whole debate is sort of a fraud argues a democratic senate staff member 
 executions regardless of how frequently they occur are also proper <unk> for <unk> crimes mr. hatch argues 
 the amendment prompted an ironic protest from mr. thurmond who complained that it would kill capital punishment 
 and the kennedy amendment would <unk> not only federal but state <unk> in two important ways 
 and it would shift the burden to prosecutors to <unk> that discrimination caused any statistical racial <unk> 
 that burden is very difficult if not impossible to meet says mr. boyd 
 how do you prove a negative 
 the kennedy amendment would in effect <unk> around the supreme court ruling 
 but if it <unk> it could prompt other statutory changes according to the mr. <unk> 
 narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever <unk> effect it now has 
 and that in turn would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances

 copper futures prices failed to extend friday 's rally 
 declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down 
 at the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound 
 all this has led to prolonged selling in futures mostly on the part of computer-guided funds 
 prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas which added to the selling

 now the personal-computer revolution is finally reaching japan 
 in april the long-term credit bank linked its computers in tokyo with its three american offices 
 productivity in japanese offices is relatively low 
 but it also offers opportunities americans are well poised to supply the weapons 
 but for now at least americans are far better at making pcs and the software that runs them 
 after years of talking about selling in japan more and more u.s. companies are seriously pouring in 
 apple computer inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year 
 <unk> inc. has a bigger share of the <unk> market in japan than at home 
 but the japanese have to go a long way to catch up 
 but amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one <unk> pc 
 moreover japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than american offices do 
 in the u.s. pcs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network 
 in japan many desktop terminals are limited to one function and ca n't <unk> with other machines 
 but the machines are n't on employees ' desks they ring the <unk> of the large office 
 some machines make charts for <unk> 
 others analyze the data 
 to transfer information from one to the other employees make <unk> and enter the data <unk> 
 to <unk> charts to branch offices they use a fax machine 
 in an efficient <unk> the same pc could perform all those tasks 
 in japan those functions account for only about a third of the software market 
 in the u.s. <unk> of the office pcs are <unk> up to some sort of network 
 in japan about N N are linked 
 but healthy skepticism is only a small reason for japan 's pc lag 
 various cultural and economic forces have <unk> demand 
 and japan 's management system makes it hard to impose a single integrated computer system <unk> 
 until recently much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least <unk> 
 some analysts estimate the average pc costs about N N more in japan than the u.s. 
 but the complex language is n't the only reason 
 with little competition the computer industry here is inefficient 
 the u.s. market too is dominated by a giant international business machines corp 
 but early on ibm offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it 
 dozens of small companies did swiftly establishing a standard operating system 
 that is the state of japan 's computer industry 
 meanwhile the big players have n't tried to copy the nec standard 
 corporate pride as well as the close ties common among japanese manufacturers help explain why 
 they hesitate to market <unk> machines nec <unk> of such machines and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship 
 the result according to many analysts is higher prices and less innovation 
 there are no price wars no competition 
 but the market is changing 
 the government is funding several projects to push pc use 
 over the next three years public schools will get N million pcs a <unk> increase from current levels 
 meanwhile more computer makers now are competing for the new business 
 it has won about N N of the retail pc market 
 but it could also help american companies which also are starting to try to open the market 
 though no formal trade barriers exist the japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter

 but the americans are also to blame 
 they long made little effort here

 only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the <unk> level 
 scientists call the new class of genes <unk> or simply <unk> genes 
 when <unk> normally they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check 
 the newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called <unk> 
 like all genes tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies one from each parent

 dr. <unk> made his retinoblastoma discovery in N 
 then last spring researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which if <unk> turns healthy colon cells <unk> 
 they have about seven candidates

 occasionally gross chromosome damage was visible

 but he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared 
 the finding <unk> medicine 
 it was extraordinarily satisfying says dr. <unk> now at fox chase cancer research center in philadelphia 
 i was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers 
 it was an <unk> claim 
 gradually a <unk> picture of cancer development emerged 
 if both copies of a certain gene were knocked out benign <unk> would develop 
 if both copies of a second gene were then <unk> the <unk> would progress to <unk> 
 it was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop 
 their report galvanized other <unk> <unk> 
 they focused on chromosome N 
 such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene 
 when they found it last winter dr. vogelstein was dubious that the search was over 
 the <unk> dr. vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 
 evidence now is emerging that the p53 <unk> gene is involved in other cancers too 
 the p53 gene has just been <unk> in lung cancer 
 at the same time the johns hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes

 as a result he <unk> the inflation that mrs. thatcher through a long and costly effort had subdued 
 with inflation surging the pound began falling against the mark 
 this put mrs. thatcher in a <unk> 
 the reason is simple 
 the price of attracting capital whether one 's own or that of foreigners is a trade deficit 
 to avoid this deficit mr. lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise 
 this <unk> policy could not prevent a british trade deficit 
 little wonder that mrs. thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep mr. lawson in office 
 it is extraordinary that the british treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by <unk> the pound

 yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago 
 and the stock market 's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there 
 there are however some alternatives that <unk> investors should consider investment advisers say 
 a mix of cds and other holdings may make the most sense 
 here 's a look at some of the alternatives 
 short-term municipals 
 investors with a heavy tax load should take out their <unk> 
 rates approach N N on five-year municipals 
 some of the more cautious cd holders might like <unk> municipals 
 the idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates 
 bond funds 
 bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell 
 buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if they are right 
 but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead 
 bond resale prices and thus fund share prices move in the opposite direction from rates 
 the price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities <unk> 
 deferred annuities 
 aimed specifically at cd holders are so-called <unk> annuities or certificates of annuity 
 some current rates exceed those on cds 
 annuities are rarely a good idea at age N because of the withdrawal restrictions

 these people have different <unk> 
 how can we turn this situation around 
 reform starts in the pentagon 
 strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process 
 they ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program 
 they would also identify the best way to add programs should the budget come in at higher levels 
 this kind of <unk> analysis is common in war planning and business planning 
 there is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning 
 two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action 
 step N <unk> up our books 
 that plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ N billion 
 it is known in the pentagon as the negative wedge 
 the N plan also assumes inflation will decline to N N by N 
 at that rate the defense plan is <unk> by $ N billion 
 note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations 
 step N will answer the question what happens if these increases do not <unk> 
 this reduces the baseline by $ N billion 
 it reduces the baseline by $ N billion 
 these <unk> would <unk> priorities by <unk> when the cost of the b-2 became <unk>

 mr. hammack is eager to know what aetna will pay for the house which has to come down 
 when will i get that check for a million dollars he jokes 
 the adjuster had n't completed all the calculations but says we 're talking policy limits 
 in this case that 's about $ N 
 we can lose money on this he says 
 so many californians believe they can get by without it 
 even ms. johnson herself made that assumption 
 i always knew that the big one was coming but not during my lifetime she says 
 now she says she 's thinking of <unk> her own insurance agent 
 for ms. johnson dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience 
 she lives in oakland a community hit hard by the earthquake

 some fund managers say negative publicity has <unk> investors ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices 
 the withdrawals could <unk> trouble for the $ N billion junk market 
 such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems 
 so the impact on the $ N billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight 
 the N mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ N billion 
 other funds hold a <unk> of junk bonds too

 if this were N mr. boren might even succeed

 last july his committee rejected a reagan administration plan to support a coup in panama 
 maine republican william cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban 
 so the administration dropped it 
 but even mr. boren <unk> congressional oversight 
 so what does consensus mean 
 it does n't mean <unk> he insists though he implies it means a bipartisan majority 
 the <unk> of u.s. foreign policy is essential he explains 
 why was <unk> so successful 
 because it had bipartisan support 
 mr. boren is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions 
 the result is that the senate committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action 
 i would n't say it 's quite a veto mr. boren <unk> 
 but would n't a president who acted despite senate objections be taking grave political risks 
 he would agrees the chairman 
 but that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead 
 mr. boren even <unk> a silver <unk> 
 he figures the episode will help clarify any <unk> between the committee and administration 
 more broadly mr. boren hopes that panama will shock washington out of its fear of using military power

 in the kind of literature i read i come across <unk> opinions quite frequently 
 we ca n't afford to wait 
 but does it have to be so soon 
 it 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher <unk> in the u.s. 
 the ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure 
 but it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in <unk> 
 another argument of the environmentalists is that if <unk> are available why not use them 
 mr. teagan cites a list of <unk> but none so far match the <unk> <unk> cfcs 
 <unk> and propane can be used as <unk> for example but are <unk>

 but the <unk> mistakenly stuck with silicon chips they needed <unk> 
 this became apparent as game one a <unk> defense by mr. kasparov <unk> 
 by move N d.t. had fallen into a deep <unk> trap 
 it allowed mr. kasparov to exchange his <unk> <unk> for one of d.t. 's <unk> 
 indeed it looked more like a pawn a tall pawn as <unk> <unk> put it 
 consistently d.t. was <unk> about its chances which it continually <unk> up in <unk> form 
 he also launched a <unk> storm <unk> a pawn to <unk> d.t. 's king 
 no amount of <unk> could have saved this game for <unk> 
 a piece down the computer resigned

 mr. kasparov <unk> later that even a weak club player would have avoided the queen move 
 now after only a dozen moves <unk> were looking for a <unk> combination 
 mr. kasparov 's <unk> was slower but in the end just as deadly 
 in a <unk> position the computer resigned rather than make its <unk> move

 dr. blumenfeld is n't unique 
 dr. blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying

 initial steps were taken at poland 's first international environmental conference which i attended last month 
 why did east bloc participants unanimously <unk> <unk> pollution approaches 
 the answer lies both in the <unk> environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that <unk> 
 like other east bloc countries poland <unk> environmental laws more <unk> in their breach than in their <unk> 
 since N average annual growth rates for most <unk> have <unk> the growth of gnp 
 a revolution takes more than conference <unk> 
 the russians are talking peace 
 the <unk> are talking elections 
 and the poles are engaged in commerce 
 those implications include privatization 
 <unk> pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries 
 <unk> solutions 
 that 's because <unk> managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals 
 creative financing 
 even <unk> environmental solutions will require billions of dollars 
 new types of financing must make funds available without <unk> poland 's <unk> reserves

 east bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets

 some traders said the sell-off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by investors 
 it 's a quiet retreat said mr. <unk> 
 it 's nothing dramatic just a routine sell-off 
 some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies he said 
 but some of it also represented profit-taking by investors who have made big gains in some issues

 why ca n't we teach our children to read write and <unk> 
 it 's not that we do n't know how to because we do 
 it 's that we do n't want to 
 here is an example 
 but what do we mean specifically by creativity 
 no one can say 
 in practice it ends up being <unk> with a <unk> that encourages the youngsters ' <unk> 
 it is not surprising that parents find this romantic <unk> so attractive 
 their commitment to creativity can not survive <unk> <unk> 
 the education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way 
 the reasons are complex but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated 
 i myself took such courses in college thinking i might end up a <unk> 
 they could all fairly be described as <unk> courses 
 but it is unfair to dump on teachers as distinct from the educational establishment 
 i know many <unk> and on the whole they are seriously committed to <unk> teaching 
 but they need not be to do their jobs well 
 yes we all can remember one or two truly <unk> teachers from our school days 
 but our education <unk> at the hands of those others who were merely competent and <unk> 
 in this sense a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor 
 if he were brilliant he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place 
 if he is competent and <unk> he serves us well 
 our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis 
 whether they are or are not <unk> is a problem of equity it is not an educational problem 
 if there were such evidence you can be sure you would have heard of it 
 in this respect it would be helpful if our political leaders were <unk> rather than <unk> concerned 
 a comprehensive development policy for governors over N would seem to be a more pressing need 
 what gov. clinton is <unk> in effect is extending the educational system down to the <unk> years 
 whether desirable or not this is a child-care program not an educational program 
 parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children 
 parents should be involved with their children 's education at home not in school 
 if parents are <unk> with a school they should have the option of switching to another 
 community involvement is an even worse idea 
 here the experience of new york city is decisive 
 in most states increasing expenditures on education in our current circumstances will probably make things worse not better 
 the reason is simple education takes place in the classroom where the influence of money is minimal 
 that is the way the system works 
 students should move up the educational <unk> as their academic potential allows 
 the notion that tracking is somehow <unk> is absurd 
 the purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential 
 no one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential 
 the latter are <unk> trendy often downright silly and at best <unk> 
 they are based on dubious psychological and <unk> theories rather than on educational experience 
 with that authority of course goes an <unk> accountability 
 schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance 
 mr. <unk> an american enterprise institute fellow <unk> the public interest and publishes the national interest

 it 's like saying get me in now or get me out now 
 profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers 
 <unk> an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than $ N 
 a limit order to sell could be entered at that price 
 one risk investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches N and then falls 
 stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses 
 if it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled 
 <unk> order the <unk> order is one of several associated with the timing of trades 
 it <unk> a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better 
 but if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled 
 i like to use them to feel out the market he says 
 <unk> order this is another timing order 
 on the close can be added to many types of orders 
 <unk> orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading 
 most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise 
 it is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed 
 mr. <unk> writes on the options and commodities markets for the wall street journal 
 in <unk> up the risks of stock-market investments there 's probably no starting place better than beta 
 but investors better not ignore its limitations either 
 beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund 
 beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret 
 cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low <unk> 
 go with <unk> stocks to get the biggest <unk> from a bet on a bull market 
 remember though that beta also has important limitations 
 in particular beta does n't measure the company and <unk> risk associated with an individual stock 
 beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own <unk> 
 in reality it 's very volatile but the movements are not because of market movements 
 ready to review the <unk> of your investment portfolio 
 first a pop <unk> 
 when you think of the words risk and investment what 's the specific <unk> that comes to mind 
 pencils down 
 u.s. treasury bonds for example are <unk> when it comes to returning money at maturity 
 risk is also a function of time 
 when financial professionals measure risk <unk> they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns 
 but the stock market despite some <unk> declines has far outperformed other securities over extended periods 
 as a result financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the <unk> of clients ' portfolios 
 they try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals 
 and they <unk> types of risk that are not easily <unk> 
 but they <unk> the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk 
 that largely reflects the heavy <unk> 
 then take the expected return and <unk> one standard deviation 
 then add and <unk> two standard <unk> to get a wider range 
 there 's a N N probability any year 's result will fall in the range 
 but they may pay a price N or N years in the future

 <unk> all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all 
 the bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning

 the recession that is 
 the economy 's <unk> steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up 
 so often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a <unk> weather <unk> 
 different tactics are called for as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher 
 a heavy <unk> of cash is prescribed along with a <unk> <unk> to bonds <unk> government bonds 
 it 's <unk> to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand 
 but that may not be possible because recessions often take investors by surprise 
 they always seem to come a bit later than you expect 
 the reason is simple mr. wyss says interest rates almost always decline during recession 
 as surely as a <unk> <unk> falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds 
 they are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do 
 that effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds 
 long-term bonds with many years left before maturity swing more widely in price 
 but not just any bonds will do 
 corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession mr. wyss says 
 as times get tougher investors <unk> about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts 
 this <unk> the price of corporate bonds 
 also he notes most corporate bonds are callable 
 but the investors are left <unk> with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are <unk> 
 if corporate bonds are bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all 
 such bonds are very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster 
 and like <unk> many municipal bonds are callable 
 investors he advises should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also <unk> bonds 
 <unk> <unk> president of <unk> financial inc. in <unk> pa. also recommends that investors go heavily for cash 
 a soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all mr. <unk> adds

 it comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market 
 that 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid 
 mr. katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years 
 investors who <unk> and <unk> up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says 
 frequent trading runs up high commission costs 
 still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming 
 after all in all five recessions since N stocks declined 
 about six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery 
 the average recession lasts about a year 
 but whatever their advice about timing none of these experts recommend <unk> stocks entirely during a recession 
 for the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions 
 low <unk> stocks he says <unk> outperform others during a recession or bear market 
 in good times he says they lag a bit but overall they provide superior performance 
 prof. <unk> urges investors to <unk> stocks in small companies 
 <unk> shares typically fall more than <unk> stocks in a recession he says 
 for example mr. <unk> says stocks of small companies are selling for about N times cash flow 
 cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation is one common gauge of a company 's financial health 
 and it 's way above the ratio N times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for

 there was just one sticking point the two had a prior commitment 
 he figured wrong 
 and they are a very odd team in any case 
 mr. guber was raised in boston and educated in new york 
 he is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees 
 mr. peters is a high-school <unk> who came to fame as <unk> <unk> 's <unk> 
 yet they are far and away the most <unk> producers in hollywood 
 and despite their share of <unk> they make movies that make money 
 that is a <unk> sony badly needs and warner is loath to lose 
 mr. guber and mr. peters are n't <unk> loved in hollywood but they are well connected 
 it falls to others to do the writing <unk> and producing 
 sometimes as with batman the pair really do make the film 
 i wish they were around N hours a day 
 and some movies seem to have been hurt by their <unk> 
 we 've had a few <unk> admits mr. peters 
 but by and large this company has only been profitable 
 he says his company 's <unk> at packaging and marketing is why we 'll be good at columbia 
 we practically ran our own studio 
 it 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material 
 he gets better reviews as a creative <unk> an <unk> an idea man 
 he also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did 
 <unk> <unk> made him famous 
 he cut her hair 
 he lived with her 
 he came to produce her records and her movies a star is born and the main event 
 mr. guber by contrast has been married to one woman for more than N years 
 peter is the bright sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal says one agent 
 if there 's a problem peter disappears and all of a sudden jon shows up 
 mr. guber and mr. peters <unk> many people in hollywood the wrong way 
 says mr. simpson the script was <unk> 
 we <unk> it 
 we are the producers of that movie 
 they got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers 
 i was upset with roger i <unk> and <unk> says mr. peters 
 but he wanted to pursue his own dream and he went 
 jon peters will come <unk> into a room say he 's got a great idea and be gone 
 peter will take the <unk> of that idea and make it grow into something specific 
 i think peter even made some deals with the <unk> 
 money helped too 
 ultimately they paid more than $ N million for the rights 
 the sale caused a <unk> between the widow and some of her husband 's <unk> 
 it 's hardly <unk> given the men 's track record that sony wants mr. guber and mr. peters 
 in the case of peter and jon the ink has been very very black 
 mr. guber got his start in the movie business at columbia two decades ago 
 among their <unk> were the <unk> of <unk> jean <unk> clue and <unk> of the <unk> bear 
 and the failures make it possible for warner in its current lawsuit to <unk> the producers as <unk> 
 from the beginning they knew we had a goal and a dream says mr. guber 
 on a number of occasions he adds he tried to get warner to buy guber peters outright 
 they always <unk> but they never acted mr. guber says 
 but the mgm plan collapsed just two weeks later 
 mr. guber and mr. peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price 
 their relationship with mr. sugarman <unk> shortly thereafter 
 sony also agreed to <unk> the producers against any liability to warner 
 and earnings have been <unk> 
 the two sides now are <unk> each other of lying 
 warner in its court filings calls it a piece of <unk> created for this litigation 
 for one thing according to mr. daly the producers requested a release in advance 
 and they say there are plenty of <unk> in hollywood for letting people out of contracts 
 the sales pitch could n't sound better 
 first there 's the name asset-backed securities 
 better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing 
 and there 's more 
 the assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest and most secure institutions 
 most earn high ratings from credit agencies 
 their yields are higher than those of u.s. treasury issues 
 and the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors 
 ready to jump 
 well think twice 
 but the <unk> may be misleading 
 skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk 
 we do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn 
 such concerns however have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of wall street 's hottest new products 
 since the spring of N financial <unk> have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities 
 they have sold issues backed by car loans boat loans and <unk> loans 
 they have offered <unk> of <unk> loans as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation <unk> 
 last year there was an issue of <unk> bonds securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders 
 some predict there will be third world bonds backed by loans to brazil argentina and other <unk> nations 
 this is the <unk> of debt says james grant editor of grant 's interest rate <unk> a newsletter 
 before the sun sets on the '80s it seems nothing will be left <unk> 
 the result is a $ N billion market according to securities data co 
 most issues have been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions 
 the entry fee is affordable issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ N 
 but skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks 
 the <unk> issue offered a yield of only about N percentage point above four-year treasury issues 
 on a $ N investment that 's a difference of only $ N a year 
 but mr. powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with <unk> accounts such as retirement plans 
 another concern is liquidity or how easily a security can be converted into cash 
 that could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature 
 that 's particularly true analysts say for certain of the securities such as those backed by <unk> loans 
 there are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities 
 evaluating asset-backed securities <unk> another problem 
 it is n't 
 in other words if there 's a problem do n't expect citibank to come to the rescue 
 the prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency 
 that also is n't easy 
 take the credit <unk> which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a <unk> company 
 the letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities 
 nor does it cover the entire portfolio 
 details of credit <unk> vary widely from issue to issue 
 underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions 
 but it could be much worse 
 some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues 
 for one thing credit-card loans are unsecured 
 what about <unk> asset-backed issues 
 <unk> we still say to stick with treasurys mr. <unk> replies 
 ratings he notes are subject to change 
 all this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people

 <unk> both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky 
 <unk> judicial examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method 
 thus a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule 
 today after mr. freeman 's plea there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient
