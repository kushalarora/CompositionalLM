DAD THERE IS A WALL THERE AND YOU KNOW

SO I I DO NOT KNOW WHEN THIS UH YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL

HALF OF US DRIVE

BUT I THINK THERE IS THERE IS
LIKE WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT NOW LOOKING BACK I AM LIKE
EVEN THOUGH I DROVE
I KNOW THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE DRIVE
BECAUSE JUST IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENED I MEAN MAYBE NOT SO MUCH ME LIKE I MADE A MISTAKE BUT IF SOMEONE WOULD
LIKE YOU KNOW MAKE A SUDDEN TURN OR A SUDDEN STOP AND I WOULD NOT HAVE THE
QUICK ENOUGH REFLEXES TO JUST REACT
LIKE PROPERLY AND AND YOU KNOW YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN

SO
YEAH I THINK UH
YEAH
HMMM

UH_HUH THAT IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU REALLY SOMETIMES YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH YOU DRANK LIKE YOU ARE WITH FRIENDS AND LIKE
YOU CANNOT REALLY YOU KNOW REMEMBER HOW MUCH YOU DRANK AND
LIKE EVERYONE'S TOLERANCE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IF YOU ATE SOMETHING OR YOU KNOW

WELL EVERYONE HAS DONE IT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE ESPECIALLY DEPENDING UPON THE AREA THAT YOU LIVE IN
AND THERE IS NOTHING READILY AVAILABLE
FOR YOU
WELL YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE I GUESS WHENEVER YOU UH
WHENEVER YOU GO OUT YOU HAVE GOT TO KNOW
YOUR LIMIT AND ALSO I MEAN LIKE ONE OR TWO BEERS IS I THINK IT IS FINE BUT

OF COURSE I SAY THAT NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ANOTHER
LANGUAGE FLUENTLY
I HAVE AH SOME GERMAN BUT
THAT IS THAT IS WAY BACK A LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL

AMERICANS NOT BEING WILLING TO LEARN OTHER LANGUAGES

SPEAK ENGLISH BUT

WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION NOW
ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T THIS IS MY THIRD CALL AND I HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THE QUESTION YET
NO
THEY'RE JUST RECORDING FOR VOICE QUALITY
THAT'S ALL THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT
THEY COULD CARE LESS IF WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THEM OR
WHAT HAVE YOU
SO ARE YOU ON YOUR CELL PHONE NOW
I AM NOT
NOPE THIS WAS A CALL COMING IN TO ME
THEY'RE RECORDING
THE VOICE QUALITY BETWEEN A HOME PHONE AND A CELL PHONE
OR A P. C. S. PHONE I SHOULD USE THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY
SO
ARE YOU UP IN THE BETHLEHEM OFFICE OR
THAT'S WHERE I'M AT TOO
SO
WELL
LET'S SEE ONE THING WE COULD CHANGE
UH
I PROBABLY WOULD OF GOTTEN MARRIED SOONER
THAT WOULD BE ABOUT IT FOR ME
RIGHT
OH DEFINITELY COLLECTIBLES
IF WE ONLY KNEW NOW WHAT WE KNEW THEN OR
KNEW THEN YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
I'M A UH TOY COLLECTOR MYSELF
YEAH I JUST WENT TO A TOY SHOW ON SUNDAY
OUT IN LEESPORT NEAR READING
AND UH
SOME OF THE STUFF I HAD WHEN I WAS LITTLE WAS KILLING ME
SOME OF THE ITEMS THERE WERE SELLING SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY OR MORE
AND I'M THINKING OH MY GOD AND IF I WANT IT BACK I GOT TO PAY THAT MUCH NOW
ALMOST IF HAD SMASHED IT WITH A HAMMER OR SOMETHING
SO
SPECIFICALLY I COLLECT LITTLE HOTWHEELS AND THE MATCHBOX CARS RIGHT NOW BUT
YEAH
WELL IT'S GOOD THOUGH AT LEAST IT'S AWAY
SO
BUT
YEAH I STILL HAVE THE CARS FROM WHEN I WAS LITTLE BUT YOU LOOK AT THEM AND IT LOOKS LIKE I DID HIT THEM WITH A HAMMER
THEY'RE NOT QUITE IN THE SHAPE THEY SHOULD BE
THAT'S THE WHOLE THING AND NOW YOU LOOK AT AND THE COLLECTORS ARE ACTUALLY BUYING THEM THAT NEVER LET THEIR KIDS PLAY WITH THEM
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS SO I'M BUYING THEM AND
I OPEN MOST OF THEM JUST FOR DISPLAY BUT
I STARTED OFF COLLECTING JUST THE JEEPS
CAUSE I OWN A JEEP
SO
AND THEN I GOT A LITTLE HAY WIRE FROM THERE
YEAH
YEAH
HAVE YOU PRICED OUT WHAT YOU OWN NOW
OH YEAH
YEAH
WOW
HUH
YOU SHOULD GO ON TO UH ONLINE AND CHECK OUT EBAY
NO I'VE ACTUALLY SOLD STUFF ON THERE AND I'VE BOUGHT STUFF ON THERE
AND I HAVE NOT HAD A PROBLEM YET AND THE ONE GUY HAD A PROBLEM WITH HE SHIPPED ME SOMETHING
THAT WAS TOTALLY OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE SAID IT WAS
AND I EMAILED HIM AND HE SAID NO PROBLEM SEND IT BACK HE I'LL SEND YOU THE CHECK FIRST WITH THE MONEY TO SHIP IT BACK TO ME
BECAUSE IF THEY GET ONE BAD COMMENT
THEY'RE SCREWED
BASICALLY I MEAN THEY'RE SHOT
SO
IT'S NOT TOO BAD I MEAN I DON'T BUY TOO MUCH STUFF OFF OF IT BUT IT'S A GOOD WAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR STUFF IS WORTH
LIKE IF YOU SEARCH ACTION FIGURES
AND YOU SPECIFICALLY PUT YOURS IT WILL DO A SEARCH OF EVERYTHING EVER SOLD ON EBAY
AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT THEY SOLD FOR
AND IT WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF JUST WHAT IT'S WORTH YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ANYTHING OR SELL ANYTHING
YOU CAN JUST DO A SEARCH ON IT
AND YOU TYPE IN THE ITEM YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
YOU KNOW STAR WARS FIGURES OR WHATEVER
SO

UH DETERMINE MINIMUM WAGE PER REGION
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU WORK IN NEW YORK YOUR UM MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU LIVE UH
IN AMISH COUNTRY PENNSYLVANIA
OR THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE
ARE YOU FROM NEW YORK CITY
ARE YOU UH
WHERE EXACTLY DO YOU WORK FOR OMNIPOINT
OH DO YOU ALL RIGHT SO DO I
UM
BUT UH
OBVIOUSLY AS YOUR STANDARD EH OR THE STANDARDS OF LIVING INCREASE UH WITH UH
UH WITH UH INFLATION AND ALL THAT OBVIOUSLY NATURALLY EH MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING TO HAVE TO INCREASE
HMMM NOT IF
NOT WITH A FAMILY ABSOLUTELY NOT
OH I AGREE NOT WITH A FAMILY OBVIOUSLY RENT OR RENT ALONE YOU FIVE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT
YEAH FIVE TWENTY FIVE AN HOUR JUST DOES NOT CUT IT
OH I USE I STARTED I THINK AT FOUR TWENTY FIVE SO STILL
BUT THEN AGAIN UH THE COST OF LIVING WAS CHEAPER
I MEAN NEW CARS THESE DAYS ARE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU ARE LUCKY TO FIND A DECENT CAR UNDER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT IS RIDICULOUS
NO
AND THEN MORTGAGES THESE DAYS I MEAN IF YOU FIND A HOME FOR UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT IS SOMEWHAT DECENT I MEAN IT IS IT IS
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS
NO
BUT EVEN IF YOU DO NOT MAKE MINIMUM WAGE YOU ARE STILL NOT MAKING ENOUGH I KNOW OURS
SO WE NOT WE ARE MAKING MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE BUT OUR SALARIES DON'T INCREASE WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE THEY SHOULD
YEAH ACTUALLY I DID I FIGURED I BETTER START DOING THIS BEFORE IT ENDS
FIFTEENTH IT ENDS THE FIFTEENTH
NO I I HAVE GOTTEN SEVERAL BUT I HAVE IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN DURING WORK HOURS AND I I JUST COULD NOT ACCEPT THE PHONE CALLS SO I JUST UH DO NOT ANSWER THEM
WELL I PUT DOWN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DAY BUT EH I ALWAYS GET THEM IN THE MORNING I I SHOULD HAVE CHANGED MY TIMES WHILE AT NIGHT BUT
IT IS JUST UH
JUST I ALWAYS GET THEM DURING WORK HOURS
YEAH FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS ARE ALL EMPLOYEES THERE IS NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT EMPLOYEES DOING IT
THAT'S RIGHT
BUT UH
SO HOW LONG ARE WE SUPPOSE DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG WE ARE SUPPOSE TO TALK ON THESE THINGS
OH I GUESS ABOUT FIVE MINUTES SO
I HAVE NO IDEA

THAT IT SHOULD IT SHOULD VARY FROM STATE TO STATE
NO
UH
BETHLEHEM
HMMM
OH YEAH
YEAH YEAH AND DEFINITELY
AND UM
THE THING THAT I SAID ABOUT UM IT IF IT SHOULD INCREASE
IN IN DIFFERENT STATES I THINK THAT IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE
LIKE WE SAID BEFORE
I DO NOT EVEN THINK FIVE TWENTY FIVE IS ENOUGH
WELL NOT NOWADAYS
THAT IS RIGHT
BUT IT IS A LOT BETTER THEN WHEN I STARTED WHEN I STARTED THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS THREE TWENTY FIVE
YEAH
OH YEAH
THAT IS THAT IS ABOUT IT EVERYTHING GOES UP BUT YOUR WAGES
YOUR LUCKY IF YOU CAN FIND A DECENT ONE AT TWENTY THOUSAND
I KNOW IT IS I MEAN

THE HOUSE THAT I AM LIVING IN WHEN IT WHEN IT WAS BRAND NEW IT WAS TWENTY ONE THOUSAND YOU CANT FIND A DECENT CAR FOR THAT
SO
OH YEAH THAT IS FOR SURE
BUT THAT KEEPS GOING UP AND WE JUST COME UP AS QUICK FOR SOME REASON
I DO NOT KNOW WHY

RIGHT
RIGHT I MEAN I I BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE
I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE HELP AND GUIDANCE
AND I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE EDUCATED

AND SO THEY SPENT THEIR TIME DOING WHAT WHAT WHAT DO THEY DO
YEAH
RIGHT RIGHT
YEAH THEY DO
THEY DO I LIVED IN FLORIDA AND I DID SEE THEM WORKING
PICKING UP TRASH FROM THE ROADS AND AND I AM NOT EVEN SAYING THAT IT NEEDS TO BE A JOB OF GARBAGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT JUST

JEFF'S CLASS
OH
YEAH
OH
JEFF SAID JEFF JUST SAID WHAT IS UP
OH
WELL
REALLY
OH BE CAREFUL OF THE FLU IT IS GOING AROUND
YOU THINK SO
I THINK THAT THE PERSON SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED
CAUSE IT VIOLATES FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO PUNISH SOMEONE FOR DOING THAT
WHAT ARE YOU
WHAT ARE YOU RETARDED
IF YOU BURN THE
BURNING THE FLAG IS IS A SYMBOL FOR IS IS A ATTRIBUTED TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH IT IS A SYMBOL FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH
SO
OH GOD
YOU DO
WHAT
OH I KNOW
SO HOW MANY MORE MINUTES DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS FIVE MORE MINUTES
WELL I CAN'T COME DOWN
I WISH I HAD A CIGARETTE UP HERE
AH
SO
YES I DID
ITS ITS
NO NO I HAVE TO ITS STEEPING
SO UM
THIS IS TOO WEIRD
SO GO AHEAD TELL ME WHAT YOU WHY DO YOU THINK A PERSON SHOULD BE PUNISHED MISTER
IS IT MORE IMPORTANT THAN FREEDOM OF SPEECH
FREEDOM
IT WOULD LET THE PEOPLE MAKE LET THE PEOPLE MAKE UP THE COUNTRY
FLAGS ARE SYMBOL FOR THE PEOPLE
SO DO YOU THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT BURN CROSSES ARE UH ANY DIFFERENT THAN THE PEOPLE THAT BURN FLAGS
WHAT'S BAD ABOUT BURNING A CROSS
THEY DON'T BURN CROSSES THEY LIGHT THEM UP
BURNING A FLAG IS NOT BAD
IT IS NOT
SHE'S KNOWS WHAT WHAT THE TOPIC IS
IS THAT WHAT
OH I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BE ME
I CAN'T BELIEVE I AM GONNA HAVE TO TALK ON THIS PHONE TWO TIMES
BECAUSE
I AM NEXT
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD BE
WHAT I HOPE NOT COULD YOU IMAGINE IF I GOT YOU
THAT'S FUNNY
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE FOR BURNING THE FLAG
HUH
PEOPLE BURN THE FLAG THEY SHOULD BE BURNED THEY SHOULD BE KILLED
HOW
OH SO YOU ARE SAYING BURNED AT THE STAKE FOR BURNING A FLAG
WELL
THAT'S HEAVY DUTY
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THE SYMBOL IS WHEN YOU SIT AROUND AND BURN PEOPLE
AND SO ONE BAD SO TWO BAD THINGS RIGHT
SO UM
YOU FEEL THEY SHOULD BE BURNED
OH
SO HOW DO YOU VIEW SO YOU SAY THAT YOU VIEW BURNING A
GO AHEAD ASK ME
I DON'T THINK
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED I DON'T THINK THAT IT THAT IT IS REALLY THAT
YOU KNOW IMPORTANT AN ISSUE THAT IT IS ONLY A PIECE OF CLOTH THAT THEY ARE BURNING
THAT THEY COULD BURN FIVE THOUSAND FLAGS AND THERE WON'T BE DESTROYING ANY KIND OF HUMAN VALUE IT IS AN OPINION
SYMBOL AND UM
DADADADADADA YOU KNOW
YES
WHY
WELL
YOU ARE RETARDED
OH THAT IS SO WEIRD
RIGHT RIGHT
WOW
I HOPE WE COULD GET THAT PIECE OF FURNITURE UPSTAIRS
YOU THINK THAT IS HARD WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE COUCH
THE SECTIONAL THAT IS GOING TO BE A BITCH TO TAKE UP THERE
YOU KNOW SO
OH
FIVE
TOO MUCH
IT IS A SHAME WE CAN'T BE CALLING EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME
NO SMOKING UPSTAIRS
SO
DID YOU MAKE ALEXANDRA HER TEA
WHERE
DID YOU GIVE IT TO HER
BECAUSE THE FLAG REPRESENTS A VERY SYMBOLIC UM
IT IS UH ITS ITS VERY SYMBOLIC AND PATRIOTIC AND
NO ITS IT THAT WHAT IT REPRESENTS FREEDOM
FREEDOM
THAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR OR OR HOW WE WERE LIKE ESTABLISHED AND
WITHOUT THAT FLAG
THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY WHAT AMERICA MEANS
YES
NO
BUT SO IS THE CROSS FOR THE CATHOLICS
THE FLAG IS THE EQUIVALENT TO THE CROSS
TO THE STAR OF DAVID
TO THE THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS
OH THEY SHOULD BE THAT'S THAT'S JUST AS BAD
THE SAME THING AS BURNING A A CARPET OR A FLAG
RIGHT
RIGHT
OKAY
OH YOU KNOW
SHE KNOWS
NO THAT IT DOES
THAT IT THE CALLS
OH YOU KNEW
HOW DID I NOT KNOW
NO I THOUGHT YOU GOT TO CALL UP THERE
THAT'S WHY YOU COULD OF STAYED DOWN HERE I GOT THE FURNITURE FRENZY
NEXT TIME ALEXANDRA COMES OVER HERE SHE WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SLEEPING OUTSIDE
OH
OKAY
DO I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN
OH I CAN'T BEAR IT
I WAS WITH YOU ALL WEEKEND GET BACK TO WORK
LONG WEEK
BUT YET I AM A
I SCRUBBED THE KITCHEN CLEAN AND THE
DEATH
PUNISHMENT BY DEATH
THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED YES
IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THEY WOULD BURN THE FLAG BURN THEM TO DEATH
YES
LIKE JOAN OF ARK
YES I BELIEVE IN THAT RICH UM
I LOVE SYMBOLISM AND IT IS UH
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IT IS A DISRESPECT TO LIFE
DEATH IS JUST IS BAD
ANYTHING THAT THAT THAT DEALS WITH DESTRUCTION IS BAD
AND THAT IS IT
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME ALL THESE QUESTIONS
YOU KNOW ME
DO YOU

NO WHY DON'T WHY DO YOU ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS GET SOME ANSWERS
I HAVE ASKED YOU THE THE SAME QUESTIONS YOU ASKED ME ASK YOURSELF AND I WILL ANSWER THEM
RIGHT
REALLY HOW DO THEY HOW ARE THEY LOOKING AT IT
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT
I THINK IT IS SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE IT FINANCIALLY ANYMORE
THAT IT JUST IT JUST MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO WAIT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND UH
YOU KNOW THE UH THE OLD SCHOOL THINKING THAT ALL RIGHT YOU GET MARRIED
AS A YOUNG PERSON TO BASICALLY FIT YOURSELF FINANCIALLY
YOU KNOW YOU WORK TOGETHER AND IT IS A LOT EASIER DOING IT THAT WAY THAN DOING IT ALONE
BUT YOU KNOW NOWADAYS YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO GET YOUR EDUCATION IN ORDER OR UM
EXACTLY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT COMPLICATES THE ISSUE TREMENDOUSLY
RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT YEAH
YEAH I HAVE ONE STEPDAUGHTER UH YEAH MY FIRST MARRIAGE MY WIFE DIVORCED AND UH THIS IS HER SECOND MARRIAGE
AND I KNOW
THE WAY YOU KNOW SHE KIND OF LOOKS AT THE WHOLE SITUATION
EH BASICALLY BOILS DOWN TO WHEN SHE MARRIED SHE MARRIED TOO YOUNG
AND YOU DO NOT MAKE THE WISEST CHOICES THEN YOU KNOW YOU ARE PREMATURE
RIGHT RIGHT YOU HAVE NOT FULLY EXPLORED WHO YOU ARE YET
YOU KNOW AND IT IS DIFFICULT IF THE OTHER PERSON THERE IS ONE THING SOME PEOPLE LUCK OUT THEY MARRY AT YOU KNOW TWELVE AND FOURTEEN ALL RIGHT
AND THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME TYPE OF PEOPLE SO THEY KIND OF GROW ON THE SAME PATH
SO YEAH OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE GOING TO BE THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT HAPPY MARRIAGE
BUT UM MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT LIKE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR DIFFERENCES AND UH
IN TODAY'S WORLD THERE IS SO MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN FIND I MEAN YOU GOT THE INTERNET NOW
YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE WITH EXACTLY YOUR INTERESTS
SO IT IT MAKES
TRYING TO STICK TOGETHER NOT SEEM RIGHT NOT SEEM THAT IMPORTANT
YOU KNOW IT IS LIKE WHAT IS THE POINT WHY SHOULD WE BE UNHAPPY WHEN YOU KNOW I WILL JUST MOVE ON RIGHT
YEAH
RIGHT SELFSERVING RIGHT
RIGHT AT WHAT EXPENSE
AT
AT AH WHAT EXPENSE AND AH YOU KNOW IT TO ME A LOT OF THAT ALSO IS UH
IT KIND OF BOILS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE OPTIONS THAT MAYBE PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE EARLY IN THE CENTURY
YOU KNOW WOMEN NOW
YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET YOUR EDUCATION AND ACTUALLY BE TREATED FAIR
ON A LOT OF LEVELS I MEAN BEFORE
THE DISCRIMINATION WAS THERE GENDER DISCRIMINATION WHERE
YOU WANTED TO GO OUT AND GET A JOB YOU HAD CERTAIN ROLES THAT YOU WERE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE TEACHER
TEACHER RIGHT AND UH FINE IF YOU GO IN THOSE ROLES YOU WERE FINE
BUT UM IF YOU DID NOT YOU HAD LIMITED OPTIONS
SO YOU WERE KIND OF STUCK AND YOU FELT YOU WERE STUCK AND UH
YOU KNOW YOU WERE KIND OF LIKE WELL EVERYONE ELSE STAYS MARRIED
AH THERE WERE NO ROLE MODELS
TO BE DIVORCED NO NO
RIGHT
BILL BIXBY
OH YEAH
I REMEMBER THAT

YES OR OR YOU KNOW THEY COUCHED IT AS WIDOW
SHE WAS A WIDOW OR HE WAS A WIDOWER SO IT WAS A DIFFERENT SITUATION YOU WERE

OH IT IS CRAZY NOW I KNOW IT IS SO CRAZY
I I THINK THAT
EH UH I I STILL THINK OF IT IN AN OLD FASHIONED WAY AS SURPRISING AS THAT MAY BE
BUT UM ALL OF OUR KIDS VIEW IT DIFFERENTLY A LOT DIFFERENTLY THAN THAN WHEN I WAS A KID
WELL THEY LOOK AT THAT IS SOMETHING THEY ARE GOING TO DO MUCH LATER IN LIFE IT IS NOT AS ROMANTICISED
YOU KNOW IT IS NOT LIKE A PRINCE CHARMING IS GOING TO COME ALONG AND UH AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE
YOU KNOW BOTH BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS IN OUR FAMILY YOU KNOW FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT GETTING A JOB GOING TO COLLEGE UM THOSE KIND OF THINGS
OH YEAH
THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT
RIGHT
RIGHT

RIGHT AND GET YOUR CAREER STARTED BEFORE YOU HAVE BABIES
RIGHT
YEAH I KNOW AND THAT IS THAT IS REALLY YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO AS FAR ESPECIALLY MY DAUGHTER FEELS ABOUT GETTING MARRIED
THAT YOU KNOW SHE HAS GOT TO GET HER CAREER STARTED UP AND GOING BECAUSE SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A FAMILY BUT
BUT HER I GUESS SHE FIGURES PRETTY MUCH ALTHOUGH I AM SURE THAT STILL AT HER AGE SHE WOULD LIKE
UM TO BE ABLE TO STAY HOME FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME
BUT I THINK SHE KNOWS THAT SHE IS YOU KNOW THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THEY MAY NOT HAPPEN AT ALL OR THAT SHE WILL DEFINITELY BE
YOU KNOW WORKING YOU KNOW FULLTIME MOST OF HER LIFE
YEAH HAVE DO YOU HAVE ANY KIDS

WHEN THERE IS HAPPINESS TO BE FOUND RIGHT BUT THAT THAT IS KIND OF IT IS SAD THAT THAT IT THAT
THAT IS KIND OF
VERY SELFISH WHICH I THINK IS A LOT DIFFERENT THEN WHAT IT USED TO BE I I DO NOT
THINK THAT THAT IS WRONG OR RIGHT BUT PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE SELFSERVING THAN THEY USED
TO BE SELFISH IS PROBABLY THE WRONG WORD UM EVERYBODY BELIEVES THAT THEY DESERVE HAPPINESS AND THEY DO
BUT I THINK WE FIND
YOU KNOW HAPPINESS A LOT DIFFERENTLY THAN THAN LIKE OR PARENTS DID
YEAH AND AT WHAT EXPENSE RIGHT RIGHT
THAT IS RIGHT
OH SURE
RIGHT

IS TERRIBLE

DO AWAY WITH IT COMPLETELY
BECAUSE IT IT PROVIDES A LOT OF JOBS
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
IT IS A BIG PART OF THE ECONOMY
AND UH I THINK EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO SMOKE

THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT A LOT OF PEOPLE
THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY TRIES TO SAY THAT
FOR YEARS HOW LONG DID THEY SAY THAT

FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
FROM EXTRA MONEY ON TOP
