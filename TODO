- Hadoopization of code
- Move parallelization to grammar level too. This will improve the performance for long sentences as it will not cause the bottleneck at one really large sentence.
- Keep a limit of maximum length you can process. If it exceeds that size... Don't process the sentence. This is a hack as really large sentences can hog the memory and will lead to halt as GC will not be able to free the memory.
- Log individual object in derivatives and Compositional Grammar to see if they really are consuming the memory. Maybe do the same for Grammar too.
